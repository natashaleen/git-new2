[Verse 1]
Mmm, I shut my eyes
You call but I just cut the line
I know your style
I know that you want one more night
And I'm backsliding
Into this just one more time

[Pre-Chorus]
Too far from over you
Beams from your M2
Are blowin' through my room
And now you lay down in my shoes
You dyed your hair blue
Oh, so much déjà vu
And now

[Chorus]
I can feel your love
Your temporary touch
It's a hit and run
You go back there when you're done
Don't you want some more?
'Cause I can feel your love

[Verse 2]
Mmm, that purple touch
Everyone who sees you falls in love
You eat us up
You live like you're on camera
You slide on top
A moon to all the juice in us
[Pre-Chorus]
Too far from over you
Beams from your M2
Are blowin' through my room
And now you lay down in my shoes
You dyed your hair blue
Oh, so much déjà vu
And now

[Chorus]
I can feel your love
Your temporary touch
It's a hit and run
You go back there when you're done
Don't you want some more?
'Cause I can feel your love
(Woo)

[Bridge]
Maybe in time
When we're both better at life
Daylight can open my eyes
And you'll still be by my side
But meanwhile
I've got my contact high
You've got your powdered lies
We've got these summertime nights
Night by night, I let you eat me alive
I want you to eat me alive
I want you to eat me alive
(Woo)
(Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
[Chorus]
I can feel your love
Your temporary touch
It's a hit and run
You go back there when you're done
I can feel your love
Your temporary touch
It's a hit and run
You go back there when you're done
I can feel your love
Your temporary touch
It's a hit and run
You go back there when you're done
Don't you want some more?
'Cause I can feel your love
