[Verse 1]
Mmm, I shut my eyes
You call but I just cut the line
I know your style
I know that you want one more night
And I'm backsliding
Into this just one more time

[Pre-Chorus]
Too far from over you
Beams from your M2
Are blowin' through my room
And now you lay down in my shoes
You dyed your hair blue
Oh, so much déjà vu
And now

[Chorus]
I can feel your love
Your temporary touch
It's a hit and run
You go back there when you're done
Don't you want some more?
'Cause I can feel your love
